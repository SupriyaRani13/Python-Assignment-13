1. What advantages do Excel spreadsheets have over CSV spreadsheets?

Sol: Excel spreadsheets and CSV (Comma Separated Values) files serve different purposes and have distinct advantages over each other
     depending on the context of their usage. 

  a) Data organization and structure: Excel allows for more complex data organization and structure compared to CSV.

  b) Formulas and calculations: Excel has built-in functions and formulas that can perform complex calculations, statistical analysis, and data manipulation.

  c) Visual representation: Excel provides various charts, graphs, and pivot tables to visualize data, which can be helpful for data analysis and 
     reporting. In contrast, CSV files only contain plain text data and do not offer any visual representation capabilities.

  d) Data filtering and sorting: Excel allows you to easily filter and sort data based on specific criteria, making it simpler to analyze and 
     extract insights from large datasets. CSV files do not have built-in filtering and sorting functions.

  e) Data protection and security: Excel provides various security features such as password protection, data encryption, and user-level access 
     control to protect sensitive information. These security features are not inherent in CSV files.


 2. What do you pass to csv.reader() and csv.writer() to create reader and writer objects?

 Sol: In Python's csv module, we can create reader and writer objects by passing file-like objects to the csv.reader() and csv.writer()
      functions, respectively. 


   1. To create a reader object:-

   Eg - import csv

     # Assuming you have a CSV file named 'data.csv'
     # Open the file in read mode and create a file object
     with open('data.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
     # Pass the file object to csv.reader() to create the reader object
     reader = csv.reader(csvfile)

     # Now 'reader' is a CSV reader object that allows you to read data from the CSV file.

   2. To create a writer object:-

    Eg - import csv

     # Assuming you want to create a new CSV file named 'output.csv'
     # Open the file in write mode and create a file object
     with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
     # Pass the file object to csv.writer() to create the writer object
     writer = csv.writer(csvfile)

     # Now 'writer' is a CSV writer object that allows you to write data to the CSV file.

   In both cases, you need to use the open() function to open the file in the desired mode ('r' for reading or 'w' for writing).
   When opening the file for reading, make sure to include newline='' as an argument to avoid issues with line endings on different platforms.



3. What modes do File objects for reader and writer objects need to be opened in?

Sol: 1. Reader Object:-

    a) The file object for the CSV reader needs to be opened in text mode with the mode 'r' or 'rt' (read mode).

    b)Additionally, you should specify newline='' as an argument to the open() function to handle newline characters correctly when reading the CSV file.

    Eg - import csv

        # Open the CSV file in read mode with newline=''
        with open('data.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
        # Pass the file object to csv.reader() to create the reader object
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile)


    2. Writer Object:-

    a) The file object for the CSV writer needs to be opened in text mode with the mode 'w' or 'wt' (write mode).

    b) Similarly, specify newline='' as an argument to the open() function when writing to the CSV file to handle newline characters properly.

    Eg - import csv

       # Open a new CSV file in write mode with newline=''
       with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
       # Pass the file object to csv.writer() to create the writer object
       writer = csv.writer(csvfile)


4. What method takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV file?

Sol: The method that takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV file is the writerow() method of the CSV writer object. 
     This method is used to write a single row of data from a list to the CSV file.

   Here's how you can use the writerow() method to write a list to a CSV file:-

   Eg - import csv

      # Assuming you have a list of data
      data_list = ['John', 'Doe', 30, 'john@example.com']

      # Open a new CSV file in write mode with newline=''
      with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
      # Create the CSV writer object
      writer = csv.writer(csvfile)

      # Use writerow() to write the list as a single row in the CSV file
      writer.writerow(data_list)

    If we have multiple rows of data (lists of lists), you can use the writerows() method to write them all at once.
    The writerows() method takes an iterable of lists and writes each list as a separate row in the CSV file. 

   Eg - import csv

       # Assuming you have a list of lists containing multiple rows of data
       data_rows = [
        ['John', 'Doe', 30, 'john@example.com'],
        ['Jane', 'Smith', 25, 'jane@example.com'],
        ['Bob', 'Johnson', 40, 'bob@example.com']
       ]

       # Open a new CSV file in write mode with newline=''
       with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
       # Create the CSV writer object
       writer = csv.writer(csvfile)

       # Use writerows() to write all the data_rows to the CSV file
       writer.writerows(data_rows)


5. What do the keyword arguments delimiter and line terminator do?

Sol: In the context of Python's csv module, the keyword arguments delimiter and line_terminator are used when working with CSV files to customize 
     the format of the CSV data. These arguments allow you to specify the characters used to separate fields (columns) and terminate lines (rows)
      in the CSV file.

  
   1. delimiter:-

     a) The delimiter argument specifies the character that separates individual fields (values) within a CSV row.
     b) By default, the delimiter is set to ',' (comma), which is the reason CSV files are often referred to as "Comma Separated Values."
     c) However, depending on your data, you might encounter CSV files that use different delimiters, such as tabs, semicolons, or other characters.

   
    Eg - import csv

        # Assuming you have a CSV file named 'data.csv' with tab-separated values
        # Open the file in read mode and create a file object
        with open('data.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
        # Pass the file object and specify the delimiter as '\t' (tab) to create the reader object
        reader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter='\t')

    2. line_terminator:-

      a) The line_terminator argument specifies the character used to terminate each line (row) in the CSV file.
      b) By default, the line_terminator is set to '\r\n' (carriage return + line feed), which is the standard line terminator for CSV files 
        on Windows systems.
      c) On other platforms, such as Unix-based systems, the standard line terminator is '\n' (line feed).

    Eg - import csv

      # Assuming you want to create a new CSV file named 'output.csv' with Unix-style line endings
      # Open the file in write mode and create a file object
      with open('output.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
      # Pass the file object and specify the line_terminator as '\n' to create the writer object
      writer = csv.writer(csvfile, line_terminator='\n')



6. What function takes a string of JSON data and returns a Python data structure?

Sol: The function that takes a string of JSON data and returns a Python data structure is json.loads(). The json module in Python provides
     this function, which is used to deserialize (parse) a JSON-formatted string and convert it into a corresponding Python data structure.


    We can use json.loads() to parse a JSON string :-

   Eg - import json

     # Assuming you have a JSON-formatted string
     json_string = '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "email": "john@example.com"}'

     # Use json.loads() to convert the JSON string into a Python data structure
     python_data = json.loads(json_string)

     # Now 'python_data' contains a Python dictionary representing the JSON data
     print(python_data)  # Output: {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'email': 'john@example.com'}


    In this example, json.loads(json_string) takes the json_string, which is a valid JSON-formatted string, and returns a Python dictionary
    representing the JSON data.



7. What function takes a Python data structure and returns a string of JSON data?

Sol: The function that takes a Python data structure and returns a string of JSON data is json.dumps().
     The json module in Python provides this function, which is used to serialize (encode) a Python data structure into a JSON-formatted string.

    Here's how we can use json.dumps() to convert a Python data structure into a JSON string :-

   Eg - import json

        # Assuming you have a Python dictionary representing some data
        python_data = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'email': 'john@example.com'}

        # Use json.dumps() to convert the Python data into a JSON-formatted string
        json_string = json.dumps(python_data)

        # Now 'json_string' contains the JSON representation of the Python data
        print(json_string)  # Output: '{"name": "John", "age": 30, "email": "john@example.com"}'

   In this example, json.dumps(python_data) takes the python_data, which is a Python dictionary, and converts it into a JSON-formatted string.
